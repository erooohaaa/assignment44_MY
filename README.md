# Assignment 4 â€“ Graphs: BFS and Dijkstra with Vertex Objects

This project implements **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** and **Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm** on an **edge-weighted graph** using custom `Vertex` objects instead of primitive types.

## ðŸ“Œ Objective

Refactor a typical graph model to use full-fledged `Vertex` objects as graph nodes and implement search algorithms that work seamlessly with this structure.

## ðŸ§© Features

- `Vertex` class for graph nodes
- `WeightedGraph<Vertex>` to represent an edge-weighted graph
- `BreadthFirstSearch` for unweighted shortest path (by number of edges)
- `DijkstraSearch` for weighted shortest path (by total cost)
- Common `Search` interface for both search types
- Example usage in `Main` class (compatible with the original assignment)

## ðŸ“¦ Class Overview

### ðŸ”¹ Vertex
Represents a node in the graph.

**Fields:**
- `String name` â€“ label of the vertex

**Methods:**
- Constructor
- `equals()` and `hashCode()` â€“ to allow correct use in `HashMap` and `HashSet`
- `toString()` â€“ for readable output

---

### ðŸ”¹ WeightedGraph<Vertex>
Represents an edge-weighted undirected graph.

**Key methods:**
- `addVertex(Vertex v)`
- `addEdge(Vertex from, Vertex to, double weight)`
- `neighbors(Vertex v)` â€“ returns adjacent vertices and weights

---

### ðŸ”¹ Search (interface)
Defines the common search methods:

- `boolean hasPathTo(Vertex v)`
- `List<Vertex> pathTo(Vertex v)`

---

### ðŸ”¹ BreadthFirstSearch
Implements the `Search` interface using **BFS**.

- Finds the shortest path in number of edges (ignores weights)

---

### ðŸ”¹ DijkstraSearch
Implements the `Search` interface using **Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm**.

- Finds the shortest path based on total edge weights

---

### ðŸ”¹ Main
Builds a sample graph and demonstrates both BFS and Dijkstra algorithms.

- Compatible with the unchanged Main class from the assignment
- Prints path and total weight where applicable
